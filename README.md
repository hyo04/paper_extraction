# Figure, table, and reference extraction 

## Introduction 
This project uses the YOLOv5's training model for the detection of figures, tables, and references from scientific research papers. It was created as the first building block of a larger project that ultimately aims at summarizing scientific research papers into a short form video. 

The YOLOv5s model trained using labeled research paper pages and the process/results were tracked using COMET. The training parameters for the best model (best.pt) were.....

## Installation 
In order to test the model with other scienfic research papers, you can download the 'test_model.py' file and run with adjustments to the path to the model, directories of the testing and output files, and the selection of device.
